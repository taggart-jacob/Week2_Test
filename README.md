# Week2_Test

1. Sort the array with multiple same values in the array in an ascending order. 
Input: {2,8,9,3,4,3,2,6,6,2,4,9,8}
Output: {2,2,2,3,3,4,4,6,6,8,8,9,9}
2. Say you have a string of characters. Write an algorithm to collect and return a list of all substrings such that order is maintained but characters may be skipped. So “frog” can produce fog, fg, rg, etc.
3. Given a 2d String array, write a method that will return a list with all the positions of
dulpicate entries. For example:

a,b,c
d,e,f
g,a,b

will return {0,0 | 0,1 | 2,1 | , 2,2 }

4. Complete the Jungle Coding Challenge
